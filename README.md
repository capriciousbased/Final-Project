## About The Project

### Final Project of Techlabs Bootcamp

This is the final project of Techlabs Web Development Bootcamp.

The overall project subject of our #codeathome Bootcamp is: 🍀 Happiness 🍀

The lockdown in Spring 2020 caused by the Corona-Virus pandemic was an imprinting experience for all of us around the globe. Many people are still affected and suffer from the economic hardship. Unemployment, existential fears, mental health and an overall uncertainty are present issues. Maybe some of those factors is what drove you to participate in our Code at Home-Bootcamp afterall. We want to make this world a happier place in this time of need!

> _"Happiness is the meaning and purpose in life, the whole aim and end of human existence."_

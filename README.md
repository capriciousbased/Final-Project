# About The Project

## Final Project of Techlabs Bootcamp

This is the final project of Techlabs Web Development Bootcamp.

The overall project subject of our #codeathome Bootcamp is: 🍀 Happiness 🍀

The lockdown in Spring 2020 caused by the Corona-Virus pandemic was an imprinting experience for all of us around the globe. Many people are still affected and suffer from the economic hardship. Unemployment, existential fears, mental health and an overall uncertainty are present issues. Maybe some of those factors is what drove you to participate in our Code at Home-Bootcamp afterall. We want to make this world a happier place in this time of need!

The mission of Motivity is to make users free-time more enjoyable. The idea was developed to counteract the inevitable weariness caused by Covid-19 lockdowns but the service will be equally valuable in post-Covid times. Based on React and Axios, the platform presents suggestions for events and activities that adhere to Covid-19 restrictions and regulations. Users can narrow down the selection via a keyword search function or by browsing the six main categories: online/offline; alone/with friends; indoors/outdoors. The service can be accessed as a guest user or by registering and thereby creating a profile for Motivity. The latter scenario is a future implementation where users will be able to create a personal profile page that displays a history of activities, a rating system as well as further suggestions based on previously selected activities and browsing behavior.
> _"Happiness is the meaning and purpose in life, the whole aim and end of human existence."_
